# To-Do App

A simple and intuitive To-Do app built with React that allows users to:

- Add new tasks
- Edit existing tasks
- Delete tasks

This project demonstrates two approaches to state management in React:

1. Using the `useState` Hook
2. Transitioning to the `useReducer` Hook

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Easily add new tasks to your to-do list.
- **Edit Tasks:** Modify existing tasks with a simple interface.
- **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks you no longer need.

## Project Purpose

This project starts with managing the app's state using React's `useState` Hook for simplicity and clarity. After the initial implementation, the project will evolve by introducing the `useReducer` Hook for better state management in more complex scenarios.

The goal is to showcase:

- When to use `useState` for state management.
- How and why to transition to `useReducer` as the app grows.

## Tech Stack

- React
- JavaScript
- CSS (or Tailwind CSS if used)
